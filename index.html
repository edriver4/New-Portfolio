                                <p>My name is Bradley and I am currently an employee at athenaHealth. I have a English
                                    Golden Retriever and his name is Charlie. Charlie is that white fluff-ball in the
                                    picture
                                    above. Anyways back to me, I am a huge University of Georgia football fan...which
                                    is very
                                    ironic since I am technically a student of the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp
                                    here
                                    at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Talk about an internal conflict! But the
                                    reason why
                                    I choose to do this program is because I wanted to change my career path towards
                                    something
                                    where I can benefit and impact the rest of the world. Or you can just say that I
                                    love coding
                                    and think is very intriguing.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>What do I like to do for fun? I really enjoy hanging out with my friends. My
                                    friends are my life, so without them I would feel lost. I have a great friend
                                    group. I also
                                    enjoy working out, I am a bit of a health nut really and enjoy fitness. Another
                                    thing that
                                    I like to do is play videogames, especially COD and Fortnite. Even though I am
                                    completely
                                    terrible at Fornite, it is still fun to play with my friends. I also enjoy spending
                                    time
                                    with my dog Charlie. Some other hobbies of mine are: spending time with my family,
                                    fishing,
                                    watching sports, going to Church, being outside, and the beach.</p>
