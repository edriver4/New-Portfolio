                            tradition
                            with fierce modernity, philosophical conceptions with old-fashioned flavour, warmth with

                            weaves a range of narratives through his dishes, playing with ingredients from the

                            <br> El Celler de Can Roca thrives on the endless creativity of the trio of gastronomically
                            talented
                            brothers behind one of the most acclaimed restaurants on the planet.Sit down at your table
                            in
                            the airy and elegant dining room of El Celler de Can Roca and you will see three rocks as
                            centrepiece.
                            Each represents one of the brothers, whose surname translates as ‘rock’ from the Spanish:
                            Joan,
                            the chef, Josep, the sommelier, and Jordi, the pastry chef.
                            <br>
                            <br> Complex creations inspired by the Rocas’ childhood memories (their parents owned a
                            restaurant
                            in Girona and still cook for the staff every day), the local ingredients or their sheer
                            creative
                            force. A sense of playfulness is instilled in the dishes, with innovative cooking
                            techniques
                            and unique presentations that stimulate the mind as much as the senses. The wine pairing,
                            which
                            enhances and complements the flavours, could be a reason to visit on its own.
                            <br>
                            <br> Highlights dishes include ‘Frozen olives’ picked directly from a bonsai olive tree
                            that explode
                            with flavour in the mouth; freeze-dried oyster shells with oyster tartare; bite-sized
                            interpretations
                            of traditional Basque dishes and a dessert infused with ‘essence of old book’.

                            Mirazur’s panoramic view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, in an idyllic palm tree-studded
                            cove
                            perched upon a hillside mere steps from the Italian border, provides reason enough to drive

                            hour from Nice. Here, chef Mauro Colagreco assembles modern, delicately flavoured dishes

                            with the essence of the Côte d'Azur via local French and Italian ingredients.

                            <br>Colagreco grows much of Mirazur’s produce on his own backyard farm, while sourcing
                            additional
                            products from the nearby Ventimiglia market. Seasonality guides his menus, which are rich
                            in
                            both vegetables and sterling seafood from the surrounding ocean. Think anchovy fillets on
                            fried
                            anchovy skeletons brightened with juice from Menton’s famous lemons, or Colagreco’s

                            <br> For those looking to experience a shorter meal, the bar offers an abbreviated
                            five-course tasting
                            menu, as compared to the dining room’s eight to 10 plates
                            <br>
                            <br>In the summer of 2017, shortly after being named The Best Restaurant in the World,
                            Eleven Madison
                            Park closed for a facelift. It reopened with a clean, updated aesthetic marked by cobalt
                            blue
                            mohair banquettes, terrazzo tiling, and a blue painting by artist Rita Ackermann that
                            presides
                            over the dining room. The team also expanded the bar area to make room for additional
                            lounge
                            tables

                            <br>For the last four years in a row, Gaggan has been voted No.1 in Asia’s 50 Best
                            Restaurants, testament
                            to the constant innovation and improvement at this ever-evolving hub of creativity. El
                            Bulli-influenced
                            chef Gaggan Anand serves up a menu of 25 or more courses of rapid-fire small bites, many of
                            which
                            are eaten with the hands.
                            <br>
                            <br>With the help of a test kitchen and some shiny new equipment, Anand’s menu has evolved
                            from purely
                            modern Indian to a much more global cuisine as the chef has travelled and taken influence
                            from
                            restaurants all over the world. The menu now includes Mexican-inspired taco bites,
                            Japanese-Indian
                            nigiri sushi and even aubergine Oreo biscuits. The classic Yoghurt Explosion remains on the
                            menu
                            alongside newer signatures such as Lick It Up, where diners are encouraged to lick a
                            flavoursome
                            curry straight from the plate.

                            <br>While Gaggan is currently the best that Asia has to offer, it won’t be for much longer,
                            as Anand
                            has pledged to close his flagship restaurant in 2020 after 10 years serving gastronomes
                            from
                            all over the globe. After the final service, he plans to open a small restaurant in
                            Fukuoka,
                            Japan, with fellow Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants chef Takeshi ‘Goh’ Fukuyama of La Maison de

                            <br>Chefs Virgilio Martínez and Pía León’s flagship restaurant is a shrine to everything
                            that is
                            Peruvian, including many ingredients that are seldom served elsewhere. The husband-and-wife
                            team
                            have been travelling the length and breadth of the country for several years to source
                            interesting
                            and unique produce from land, sea and mountains.

                            <br>Martínez and León like to play with the many varieties of corn, potato and much more
                            obscure
                            products offered by Peru’s vastly biodiverse landscape. Classics include Land of Corn and

                            sharp-tooth-filled piranha head. The menu explores every altitude, from 20 metres below sea
                            level
                            to 4,100 metres above it, in 17+ courses.
